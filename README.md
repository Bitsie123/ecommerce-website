Title - Updated version of Aliexpress website as part of a college assignment

For another assignment, I conducted a critical usability and accessibility assessment of the AliExpress website and proposed a redesign aimed at enhancing user experience. One key improvement I suggested was adding a 'Return to Homepage' button to the Help Center page. This simple addition to the navigation bar empowers novice users to quickly return to the homepage, improving the siteâ€™s navigation and reducing user frustration. I also revamped the homepage design, introducing a more vibrant colour scheme aligned with the AliExpress brand, emphasising key elements like the price display to capture user attention. The footer was enhanced with a hover effect, transitioning to a dark-mustard colour, reinforcing AliExpress's branding. These updates aim to improve both usability and visual appeal, making the website more user-friendly and visually engaging.
